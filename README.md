 Basic Portfolio Website hosted on GitHub

 # Projects completed on course so far:

 1) Basic HTML Website
 2) Basic BootStrap Website
 3) Basic Portoflio Website

Each one presented different challenges to navigate. 
The first, HTML website, challenged me to create everything from scratch. To make a visually appealing site that uses only HTML and CSS. It was quite challenging and required that I do extra research outside of the course to properly align elements, figure out sizing, and customise things the way I intended.
The second one, the basic BootStrap Website, was quite interesting. I followed along with the videos and created a site very similar to the one shown. It allowed me to understand how different parts can come together to make somethign cohesive. 
Finally, the basic portfolio website challenged me to find a template and make it my own. Now that I have a better understanding of how the pages come together, how the CSS works, and how it all interacts, I found it a lot easier to edit parts and adapt the page to what I wanted.
